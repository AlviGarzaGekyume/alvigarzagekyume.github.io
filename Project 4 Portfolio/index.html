  <h2> About </h2>
  <p> I am currently a college senior that will soon be graduating. I have taken this semester to take a variety of art classes to achieve some art skills. I will be graduating from the <a href="https://www.uic.edu/"> University of Illinois at Chicago </a> with a Bachelor's in Liberal Arts and Sciences, double majoring in Criminology, Law, & Justice and Psychology. </p>
  <p> This portfolio will contain a collage of work done in my Practices in Digital Arts class, as well as some photography taken by me in my photography class.
