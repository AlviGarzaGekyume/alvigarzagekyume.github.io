<p> This project involved creating a website and using a previous text with one of my friends wich became the basis of the material that was given for the poem. 
  I used that last text with a friend and searched it on crhome and whatever was on the web search page was used to create my poem. The theme of my poem resulted with images
  that displayed some type of relationship/bond. We been together through a lot over our lives and this poem website <a href=" "> Friends Right? </a>. Clickiing on that 
  will take you directly to the website. </p>
