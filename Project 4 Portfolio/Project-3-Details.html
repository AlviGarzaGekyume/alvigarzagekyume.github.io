<p> I used Twine in order to create this non-linear game. It was inspired by a game that recently came out that is called Elden Ring. The game gives you various choices
in how to progress in the game, there is four different endings to get based on your actions in the game. There is two different class to play as. The images above show
the title screen as well as a map of the routes that can be taken in game, from the developing side in creating the twine game. If you want to check out the game click <a href="https://alvigarzagekyume.github.io/Project%204%20Portfolio/Dungeons%20Abyss%20(2).html"> here </a>. </p>
