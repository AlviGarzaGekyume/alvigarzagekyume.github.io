<p> This project consisted of me taking photographs for a final project in my Digital Photography class. I was allowed to choose the type of photograhy/theme for my final.
I ended up just choosing a topic of "eye pleasing". This pertain to photographs that I took, that stood out the most to my eyes and hoped to share that with others. My 
pictures ranged from the urban pictures, food, outdoors, and art. </p>
