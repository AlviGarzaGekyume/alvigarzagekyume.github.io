<p> This project was meant to create a background that would take you to another world. The world mine had take you to is Star Wars. I am a big fan of this franchise 
 and felt like having my own personal background to display on zoom would allow me to be more comfortable. The background has 3 different sections that take place in different times
 in the movie. The first part of the live background diplays areas of the Jedi temple, such as its exterior view and Jedi Archives areas. The second sections inloves areas 
 within the jedi temple where younglings learn the teachings of the jedi and have some practice deflecting laser bolds from test droids. The last section of the background displays
 when the Jedi Temple is attacked. During the live background, the audio version plays this song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2p-im7cxa4"> Anakin's Betrayal </a>.
 I choose these specific scenes due to them being the most emotional in the franchise to me, Star Wars has always played a big part of my childhood! </p>
